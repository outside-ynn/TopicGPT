{"id":"110-S-27","summary":"Title I: San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act - San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act - (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to implement the Stipulation of Settlement dated September 13, 2006, in Natural Resources Defense Council, et al. v. Kirk Rodgers, et al., in cooperation with the state of California, including measures to: (1) design and construct channel and structural improvements; (2) modify Friant Dam operations to provide Restoration Flows and Interim Flows; (3) acquire water, water rights, or options to acquire water from willing sellers; (4) implement terms and conditions related to recirculation, recapture, reuse, exchange, or transfer of water released for such flows; and (5) develop and implement the Recovered Water Account.Directs the Secretary to: (1) enter into agreements with California to facilitate or expedite Settlement implementation; and (2) identify impacts associated with actions and measures to mitigate impacts on adjacent and downstream water users and landowners. Provides that Settlement implementation and the reintroduction of Chinook salmon shall not result in the involuntary reduction in contract water allocations to Central Valley Project long-term contractors apart from Friant Division contractors. (Sec. 105) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) acquire from willing sellers property needed to implement the Settlement; and (2) dispose of property no longer needed. Requires: (1) the Secretary, upon determining that property acquired through eminent domain authority is no longer necessary for implementation of the Settlement, to provide a right of first refusal to the former owner on the same terms and conditions being offered to other parties; and (2) proceeds from the disposal of such property to be deposited into the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund (established by this title). (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce to comply with applicable law, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), and complete applicable environmental reviews and consultations as necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Settlement. Declares that nothing in this Act preempts state law or modifies any existing U.S. obligation under federal reclamation law to operate the Central Valley Project in conformity with state law. Authorizes the Secretary to provide necessary funds for affected federal, state, and local agencies and Indian tribes to effectively participate in the environmental review process if used to support only activities that directly contribute to the implementation of the Settlement's terms and conditions. Makes the United States' share of the costs of implementing this title nonreimburseable under federal reclamation law, subject to a limitation. (Sec. 107) Declares that: the Settlement satisfies and discharges the Secretary's obligations under the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992, subject to specified assessment and collection requirements. (Sec. 109) Requires: (1) the costs of implementing the Settlement to be covered by payments or in-kind contributions made by Friant Division contractors and other non-federal parties, with specified costs shared by the state of California; (2) the Secretary to enter into agreements with California to fund or implement improvements on a project-by-project basis; and (3) that costs incurred solely to implement this Settlement that would not otherwise have been incurred shall not be borne by any entity, public or local agency, or subdivision of a state except on a voluntary basis.Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to use not to exceed $2 million (October 2006 price levels) from the the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund for purposes of this title in any fiscal year.Establishes in the Treasury the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund. Requires the Secretary to: (1) study the costs of undertaking work required to increase the capacity of Reach 4B of the San Joaquin River prior to reinitiation of Restoration Flows, the impacts associated with reinitiation, and measures to mitigate impacts (which shall be completed prior to restoration of any flows other than Interim Flows); and (2) report to Congress within 90 days after issuing a determination required by the Settlement on whether to expand channel conveyance capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second in Reach 4B or use an alternative route for pulse flows. Provides that if the Secretary's estimated federal cost for expanding Reach 4B would exceed the remaining federal funding authorized by this title, Congress must increase the applicable authorization ceiling to cover the higher estimated costs before the Secretary commences actual construction work to expand capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second to implement this Settlement. (Sec. 110) Directs the Secretary, prior to December 31, 2010, to convert certain listed existing Friant Division, Hidden Unit, and Buchanan Unit long-term irrigation water service contracts to repayment contracts. Authorizes the Secretary to convert other existing long-term water service contracts for irrigation and municipal water deliveries by that date. Requires all such contracts to require the repayment of the remaining amount of construction costs allocated to each contractor by January 31, 2011 (or by January 31, 2014, if payment is made in approximately equal annual installments). Provides for payment of additional construction or other capitalized costs properly assignable to the contractor. Provides that the repayment contracts will continue as along as the contractors pay applicable charges.Requires payments to be adjusted as set forth following a final allocation of the costs of Central Valley Project construction. Specifies the applicability of existing provisions of Reclamation law. Directs the Secretary: (1) to waive pricing provisions of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 for a contractor upon such contractor's repayment of construction costs, provided that the contractor continues to pay applicable operation and maintenance costs and other charges; and (2) beginning in 2020, to reduce a charge mandated under that Act as provided in the Settlement for a specified period. Provides that: (1) if certain conditions are met, upon the first release of Interim Flows or Restoration Flows pursuant to the Settlement, any agreement to which a long-term Friant contractor that converts its contracts is a party and which provides for the transfer or exchange of water not released as Interim Flows or Restoration Flows shall be deemed to comply with provisions of such Act; and (2) any such water transferred or exchanged shall not be counted as a replacement or offset under the Settlement (with an exception).Provides that nothing in this title shall: (1) be construed to alter the repayment obligation of, or shift any other costs to, other long-term water contractors receiving water from the Central Valley Project; or (2) affect the right of any Friant Division long-term contractor to use a particular type of financing to make certain required payments.(Sec. 111) Provides for the reintroduction of Chinook salmon into the San Joaquin River if the Secretary of Commerce finds that a reintroduction permit may be issued under ESA. Directs that Secretary to: (1) issue a final rule under ESA governing the incidental take of reintroduced salmon and providing that the reintroduction will not impose more than de minimus water supply reductions, additional storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties; and (2) report to Congress by December 31, 2024, on progress made and on the Secretary's plans.Directs the Secretary to exercise authority under the Federal Power Act by reserving the right to file prescriptions in proceedings for projects licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on the Calaveras, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Merced, and San Joaquin rivers.Title II: Study to Develop Water Plan; Report - (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, to provide direct financial assistance to the California Water Institute to study the coordination and integration of sub-regional integrated regional water management plans into a unified Integrated Regional Water Management Plan for specified counties in the San Joaquin River Hydrologic Region and Tulare Lake Hydrologic Region that would: (1) address issues related to water quality, supply, conveyance, reliability, conservation and efficient use, flood control, water resource-related environmental enhancement, and population growth; and (2) serve as a guide for the counties to address and solve long-term water needs in a sustainable and equitable manner. Title III: Friant Division Improvements - (Sec. 301) Directs the Secretary to conduct feasibility studies on: (1) restoration of the capacity of the Friant-Kern and Madera Canals to the capacity previously designed and constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation; and (2) reverseflow pump-back facilities on the Friant-Kern Canal, with specified reverse-flow capacity at the Poso and Shafter Check Structures and at the Woollomes Check Structure. Authorizes the Secretary, upon completion of such studies, to construct those improvements and facilities.(Sec. 302) Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to local agencies within the Central Valley Project for the planning, design, environmental compliance, and construction of local facilities to bank and recover water underground or to recharge groundwater, provided the project meets specified criteria. Makes a project eligible for federal financial assistance only if all or a portion of the project is designed to reduce, avoid, or offset the quantity of the expected water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term contractors caused by the Interim or Restoration Flows authorized in title I and such quantities have not already been reduced, avoided, or offset by other projects. Limits the federal financial assistance provided to local agencies to 50% of the costs associated with planning, design, and environmental compliance activities associated with such a project and 50% of construction costs.

{"id":"114-S-1177","summary":"Every Student Succeeds Act\n\nTITLE I--IMPROVING BASIC PROGRAMS OPERATED BY STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES\n\nPart A--Improving Basic Programs Operated by State and Local Educational Agencies\n\n(Sec. 1002) This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to reauthorize through FY2020 the following programs: (1) state assessments; (2) education of migratory children; (3) prevention and intervention for children and youth who are neglected, delinquent, or at-risk; and (4) federal evaluation activities.\n\n(Sec. 1003) The bill consolidates funding for School Improvement Grants, which are aimed at turning around the lowest-performing schools, into the title I-A funding formula. (Title I-A funding supports the instructional needs of students from low-income families.) Specifically, the bill: (1) eliminates the standalone grant program, and (2) increases the proportion of title I-A funding that a state shall reserve for school improvement.\n\nOf the amount reserved, a state shall: (1) allocate 95% to local educational agencies (LEAs), whether on a formula or competitive basis, for activities to support the improvement of the lowest-performing schools; or (2) with the LEA's approval, provide for these activities directly.\n\n(Sec. 1004) A state may reserve up to 3% of its title I-A funding to award grants for direct student services to geographically diverse LEAs that serve low-performing schools. An LEA shall use these grant funds to support direct student services including: (1) a student's enrollment and participation in academic courses not otherwise available at the student's school; (2) credit recovery and academic acceleration courses that lead to a regular high school diploma; (3) activities that assist students in successfully completing postsecondary level instruction and examinations that are accepted for credit at institutions of higher education; and (4) if applicable, transportation to allow a student enrolled in a low-performing school to transfer to another public school. This option to reserve funding replaces several smaller competitive grant programs and supports similar activities.\n\n(Sec. 1005) Current law requires a state that receives title I-A funding to submit a state plan for approval by the Department of Education (ED). The bill specifies that a state plan must be reviewed by peer reviewers whose names are made public. If ED rejects a state's plan, the state shall: (1) have the opportunity to revise its plan, (2) be provided technical assistance, and (3) be afforded a hearing.\n\nCurrent law requires a state that receives title I-A funding to adopt academic standards in reading and language arts, mathematics, and science. The bill requires a state to demonstrate that such standards are aligned with: (1) the entrance requirements of the state's system of public higher education, and (2) relevant state career and technical education standards. A state's standards shall include at least three levels of achievement. A state shall not be required to submit its standards to ED for review or approval.\n\nThe bill maintains the requirement for a state to administer student assessments in reading, mathematics, and science, according to an established testing schedule. A state may administer either a single assessment or multiple assessments that result in a single, summative score. If specified requirements are met, a state may administer computer adaptive assessments. (Such assessments adapt to the examinee's ability level.)\n\nAn LEA may administer a locally selected, nationally recognized assessment in lieu of the statewide high school assessment if specified standards and notice requirements are met.\n\nWith respect to students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, a state may: (1) adopt alternative academic achievement standards, and (2) administer alternative assessments that are aligned with those standards. Neither a state nor ED may cap the percentage of students taking an alternative assessment at the LEA level, but if that percentage exceeds 1%: (1) the LEA must submit justification to the state, and (2) the state must provide additional oversight.\n\nA state may cap the amount of time spent on assessments for each grade.\n\nUnder current law, a state is required to establish long-term goals based on the requirement that all students attain a proficient or higher level of achievement within a specified timeframe. The bill instead requires a state to establish long-term goals for all students and individual subgroups based on: (1) academic achievement as measured by proficiency on required state assessments, and (2) graduation rates. With respect to subgroups, goals must account for the level of improvement necessary to make significant progress in closing statewide gaps in proficiency and graduation rates. With respect to English learners, a state shall establish goals for increasing the percentage of students achieving English language proficiency within a timeframe determined by the state.\n\nUnder current law, a state must determine the average yearly progress (AYP) for all students and subgroups at the school, LEA, and state level; AYP standards\u00a0mandate specified thresholds of performance with respect to assessments and graduation rates. The bill replaces AYP standards with a requirement for states to annually measure all students and individual subgroups by: (1) academic achievement as measured by state assessments; (2) for high schools, graduation rates; (3) for schools that are not high schools, a measure of student growth or another valid and reliable statewide indicator; (4) if applicable, progress in achieving English proficiency by English learners; and (5) at least one additional valid and reliable statewide indicator that allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance.\n\nA state is required to assign weight to each indicator and establish a system for meaningfully differentiating, on an annual basis, among schools based on those indicators. Based on this system, a state shall develop a methodology for identifying low-performing schools for support and improvement. Specifically, a state shall identify: (1) the lowest-performing 5% of schools receiving title I-A funds; (2) high schools failing to graduate at least one third of students; (3) schools that have been required to implement additional targeted support but have not improved within a specified timeframe, as determined by the state; and (4) additional statewide categories, at the state's discretion. With respect to identified schools, LEAs shall be required to develop a plan to improve outcomes. Schools with a consistently underperforming subgroup must develop and implement targeted support and improvement plans. For schools that continue to fail to improve, a state shall take more rigorous action, as determined by the state.\n\nA state plan shall describe how the state will assist LEAs in: (1) providing early childhood education programs, (2) improving school conditions for learning and meeting the needs of students, and (3) serving homeless children and youths. In addition, a state plan must describe how the state will address disparities that result in low-income and minority students being taught by ineffective teachers at a disproportionate rate.\n\nA state shall make public any criteria for measuring the effectiveness of teachers and school leaders.\n\nEach state shall prepare and publicly disseminate an annual report card that describes the state's accountability system and includes information regarding student performance, as specified by the bill. Similarly, an LEA shall prepare and disseminate an annual local report card.\n\nED shall provide to Congress an annual report card that provides specified national and state-level data.\n\nThe bill prohibits ED from attempting to influence, incentivize, or coerce a state to adopt the Common Core State Standards or any other academic standards common to a significant number of states.\n\n(Sec. 1006) The bill requires an LEA plan to include contents similar to those required of state plans.\n\nAn LEA must inform a child's parents that they may request information regarding the professional qualifications of their child's teacher. In addition, an LEA must notify parents: (1) of policies regarding students' participation in statewide assessments; and (2) in the event that their child was identified as an English learner, the services for which the child is eligible.\n\n(Sec. 1007) Under current law, if title I-A funds are insufficient to serve all eligible school attendance areas, an LEA shall serve in descending order of concentration such areas in which the concentration of children from low-income families exceeds 75%. The bill lowers this threshold to 50%.\n\nCurrent law requires an LEA to use specified measures of poverty to identify, and determine allocations to, eligible school attendance areas. The bill allows an LEA, with the approval of a majority of secondary schools, to calculate poverty in such schools based on data regarding elementary school attendance areas that feed into the secondary school.\n\nUnder current law, an LEA shall reserve funds to serve children and youths who are homeless, delinquent, or neglected. The amount of such funds may be determined based on a needs assessment, as specified by the bill.\n\nAn LEA may reserve a portion of funds to provide early childhood education programs for eligible children.\n\n(Sec. 1008) If granted a waiver from the state educational agency (SEA), a school in which less than 40% of the children enrolled are from low-income families may consolidate and use title I-A funds to operate a schoolwide program. An eligible school operating a schoolwide program shall develop a comprehensive plan or amend its existing plan, as specified by the bill.\n\nA secondary school operating a schoolwide program may use title I-A funds to operate dual or concurrent enrollment programs that address the needs of low-achieving secondary school students.\n\n(Sec. 1009) Under current law, a school that does not operate a schoolwide program may use title I-A funds to provide targeted assistance to eligible children identified as having the greatest need for assistance. The bill allows a secondary school that operates such a targeted assistance program to use title I-A funds to provide dual or concurrent enrollment program services.\n\n(Sec. 1010) The bill expands parental involvement policies to involve other family members. An LEA may receive title I-A funds only if it conducts outreach to all children's parents and family members.\n\nFunds reserved for parent and family engagement shall be distributed with priority given to high-need schools. An LEA shall use such funds to carry out activities and strategies consistent with its parent and family engagement policy, as specified by the bill.\n\n(Sec. 1011) An SEA shall designate an ombudsman to monitor and enforce requirements related to the equitable provision of services to children enrolled in private schools.\n\nWith respect to the equitable provision of services, an LEA shall consult with appropriate private school officials and explain any disagreements in writing, as specified by the bill.\n\n(Sec. 1012) An educational agency shall use title I-A funds to supplement, rather than supplant, nonfederal funds for the education of students participating in assisted programs.\n\n(Sec. 1013) LEAs using title I-A funds to provide early childhood education programs shall develop agreements with Head Start agencies and other entities to carry out such activities.\n\n(Sec. 1014) The bill: (1) increases by 0.1% the portion of title I-A funds that ED must reserve to meet the educational needs of Indian children and children in the outlying areas, and (2) specifies how such funds are to be allocated between the two groups. (The outlying areas include the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.)\n\n(Sec. 1017) Under current law, ED shall reduce a state's funding under the Education Finance Incentive grant program if the state fails to satisfy certain maintenance of effort requirements. The bill specifies that a state that fails to satisfy such requirements is entitled to receive its full allotment of funds unless it also failed the meet those requirements in at least one of the five immediately preceding fiscal years.\n\nPart B--State Assessment Grants\n\n(Sec. 1201) The bill retains state assessment grants for the development and administration of state assessments.\n\nIn addition, ED shall award grants to a state for the purpose of auditing the state's assessment system.\n\nED may also authorize a limited number of SEAs to establish innovative assessment systems, as described by the bill. Once ED has submitted a required progress report, it: (1) may extend such authority to additional SEAs, and (2) shall disseminate best practices related to innovative assessment systems.\n\nPart C--Education of Migratory Children\n\n(Sec. 1301) The bill revises the formula for allocating program funding to states by eliminating the base amount. Through FY2019, no state shall receive less than 90% of its allocation for the preceding fiscal year.\n\nED shall develop and implement a procedure for monitoring the accuracy of information regarding the actual number of migratory children in each state.\n\nPart D--Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-risk\n\n(Sec. 1401) The bill retains grants for prevention and intervention programs for children and youth you are neglected, delinquent, or at-risk. To be eligible, a state must describe how it will prioritize the attainment of a regular high school diploma for such children. Furthermore, an SEA must establish: (1) procedures to ensure the timely reenrollment of each student who has been placed in the juvenile justice system, and (2) opportunities for such students to participate in credit-bearing coursework.\n\nThe bill specifies that an SEA may use grant funds for pay-for-success initiatives or to provide targeted services for youth you have come in contact with both the child welfare system and the juvenile justice system.\n\nWith respect to subgrants, the bill specifies that an LEA may use funds for pay-for-success initiatives or to provide programs for at-risk Indian children and youth.\n\nA correctional facility that contracts with a subgrantee LEA must, upon a youth's entry into the correctional facility: (1) work with the youth's family members and the applicable LEA to facilitate the youth's transition, and (2) consult with the LEA upon the youth's discharge from the facility.\n\nFor purposes of the grant program, the bill expands the definition \"at-risk\" to include school-aged individuals who: (1) have come into contact with the child welfare system in the past, or (2) are at risk of dependency adjudication or delinquency adjudication.\n\nPart E--Flexibility for Equitable Per-pupil Funding\n\n(Sec. 1501) The bill authorizes ED to enter into up to 50 local flexibility demonstration agreements, through which LEAs may consolidate and use funds to develop and implement a school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for low-income and disadvantaged students.\n\nSuch a funding system shall ensure that each high-poverty school receives, in the first year of the demonstration agreement: (1) more per-pupil funding for low-income students than it received in the preceding year, and (2) at least as much per-pupil-funding for English learners as it received in the preceding year. An LEA shall ensure that the system allocates substantially more funding to English learners and low-income or otherwise disadvantaged students than to other students.\n\nED may extend the demonstration program if specified requirements are met.\n\nPart F--General Provisions\n\n(Sec. 1601) The bill allows ED to propose a regulation according to an alternative process, as specified by the bill, under certain circumstances.\n\nTITLE II--PREPARING, TRAINING, AND RECRUITING HIGH-QUALITY TEACHERS, PRINCIPALS, OR OTHER SCHOOL LEADERS\n\n(Sec. 2002) The bill reauthorizes the program through FY2020.\n\nWith respect to grant funds to states for improving teacher quality, the bill phases in several modifications to the funding formula. Specifically, over several fiscal years, the bill: (1) reduces and ultimately eliminates the base funding amount; (2) adjusts the funding formula, such that population is weighted less heavily and poverty is weighted more heavily; and (3) eliminates the applicability of specified hold harmless provisions.\n\nThe bill makes several modifications to state activities and application procedures under the grant program. A state may use grant funds, in part, to improve equitable access to effective teachers. If a state plans to use grant funds for this purpose, it shall describe in its application for grant funds how it will do so. A state shall also include, in its application for grant funds, descriptions of: (1) the state's system for certifying and licensing teachers and school leaders, and (2) how the SEA will encourage opportunities for increased autonomy for teachers and school leaders.\n\nWith respect to subgrants to LEAs, the bill: (1) eliminates the base funding amount, and (2) makes several modifications to application requirements and allowable uses of subgrant funds.\n\nA state shall report on: (1) how it is using grant funds to meet the purpose of the program, and (2) other specified information. An LEA shall submit to the SEA such information as the state requires.\n\nA state shall reserve a portion of these grant funds to carry out the following national programs:\n\n Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program; Literacy Education for All, Results for the Nation; American History and Civics Education; Supporting Effective Educator Development; School Leader Recruitment and Support; Technical Assistance and National Evaluation; and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Master Teacher Corp. Through the Teachers and School Leader Incentive Program, ED shall award competitive grants to eligible entities for the development, implementation, or expansion of performance-based compensation systems or human capital management systems. While ensuring equitable geographic distribution to the extent practicable, ED shall give priority to eligible entities that concentrate proposed grant activities on teachers and school leaders in high-need schools. Grantees shall provide matching funds equal to 50% of the grant amount.\n\nThrough the literacy education program, ED shall award competitive grants to enable SEAs to: (1) develop or enhance comprehensive literacy instruction plans and effective strategies in reading and writing, and (2) provide subgrants to eligible entities for literacy education activities. In awarding grant funds under the program, ED shall give priority to SEAs that will use the grant funds for evidence-based activities.\n\nED shall award competitive grants to eligible entities for the establishment of Presidential and Congressional Academies for the Teaching of American History and Civics, through which seminars or institutes shall be offered to teachers and students. Grantees shall provide matching funds equal to 100% of the grant amount. ED shall also award competitive grants to eligible entities for innovative approaches or professional development programs in American history, civics, and geography.\n\nIn addition, ED shall award competitive grants to eligible entities for: (1) effective educator development, and (2) school leader recruitment and support. Grantees shall provide at least 25% of the cost of grant activities. ED shall give grant priority to eligible entities that will implement evidence-based activities.\n\nED must also establish a comprehensive center on students at risk of not attaining full literacy skills due to disability. With respect to such students, the center shall: (1) identify evidence-based assessment tools, strategies, and accommodations; (2) identify professional development for teachers and school leaders; and (3) disseminate specified information and resources.\n\nAdditionally, ED may award grant funds to SEAs for: (1) implementation or expansion of effective STEM professional development programs; or (2) the development of state-wide STEM Master Teacher Corps to attract and retain outstanding STEM teachers, particularly in high-need and rural schools.\n\nThese programs replace several smaller competitive grant programs and support similar activities.\n\nThe bill eliminates the requirement that teachers be \"highly qualified\" and instead requires that they meet applicable state requirements for certification and licensure.\n\nTITLE III--LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND IMMIGRANT STUDENTS\n\n(Sec. 3001) The bill reauthorizes through FY2020 and revises language instruction programs for English learners and immigrant students.\n\n(Sec. 3003) The bill retains formula grants to states for English language acquisition. A state may use such a grant, in part, to establish and implement standardized statewide entrance and exit procedures. A state shall describe how it will do so in its state plan.\n\nA state shall also describe in its state plan: (1) how it will monitor subgrantees' progress in helping English learners achieve English proficiency, and (2) the steps it will take to further assist subgrantees if strategies are ineffective.\n\nEligible entities receiving subgrants shall use the funds, in part, to implement effective activities and strategies that enhance or supplement language instruction educational programs for English learners. Such activities shall include parent, family, and community engagement activities.\n\nA subgrantee may use the funds, in part, to offer early college or dual enrollment programs or courses to help English learners achieve success in postsecondary education.\n\nA subgrantee shall include in its local plan an assurance that it will, if applicable, coordinate activities and share relevant data with local Head Start agencies and other early childhood education providers.\n\nThe bill retains National Professional Development Project grants and extends grant eligibility to public or private entities with relevant experience and capacity. Additionally, the bill allows such grants to be used to: (1) support strategies to increase parent, family, and community engagement in the education of English learners; (2) develop and share effective practices in the instruction of English learners; and (3) support strategies that promote English learners school readiness.\n\nTITLE IV--21ST CENTURY SCHOOLS\n\nPart A--Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants\n\n(Sec. 4101) The bill establishes the Student Support and Academic Grant Program, through which states and LEAs may receive formula-based grants to support activities related to: (1) well-rounded educational opportunities, (2) student health and safety, and (3) the effective use of technology. This program replaces several smaller competitive grant programs and supports similar activities.\n\nPart B--21st Century Community Learning Centers\n\n(Sec. 4201) The bill makes several administrative changes to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program, which supports academic enrichment opportunities for children during non-school hours.\n\nPart C--Empowering Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools\n\n(Sec. 4301) The bill replaces the existing charter school grant program with a program awarding competitive grants to state entities and, through them, competitive subgrants to charter school developers to open new charter schools and expand and replicate high-quality charter schools.\n\nED is authorized to award a competitive grant directly to a charter school developer in a state that does not receive such a grant.\n\nGrantees shall: (1) provide technical assistance to subgrantees and authorized public chartering agencies, and (2) work with those agencies to improve the charter school authorization process.\n\nED may waive certain statutory or regulatory requirements, as specified by the bill.\n\nWith respect to the per-pupil facilities aid program (under which the Secretary makes competitive matching grants to states to provide per-pupil financing to charter schools), the bill allows states to: (1) partner with organizations to provide up to 50% of the state share of funding for the program; and (2) receive more than one program grant, so long as the amount of the grant funds provided to charter schools increases with each successive grant.\n\nED shall: (1) provide technical assistance to grantees, (2) disseminate best practices, and (3) evaluate the program's impact on student achievement.\n\nA charter school may serve students in early childhood education programs or postsecondary school students.\n\nThe bill reauthorizes the program through FY2020.\n\nPart D--Magnet Schools Assistance\n\n(Sec. 4401) In awarding grants to magnet schools, ED shall prioritize applicants that propose to increase racial integration by accounting for socioeconomic diversity in program in design and implementation.\n\nGrant funds available to magnet schools may be used for transportation under specified circumstances.\n\nThe bill reauthorizes the program through FY2020.\n\nPart E--Family Engagement in Education Programs\n\n(Sec. 4501) The bill authorizes ED to award grants to organizations to establish statewide family engagement centers. A grantee shall use the grant funds to train and assist educational agencies and other organizations in: (1) helping parents to participate effectively in their child's education, and (2) developing and implementing statewide family engagement policies and systemic initiatives.\n\nThe Department of the Interior shall establish and operate, or contract with specified organizations to establish and operate, family engagement centers.\n\nPart F--National Activities\n\n(Sec. 4601) The bill establishes several new programs that replace smaller competitive grant programs and support similar activities.\n\nED shall award grants to eligible entities for the development and implementation of entrepreneurial, evidence-based, field-initiated innovations to improve student achievement and attainment for high-need students. ED must award a portion of grant funds to grantees in rural areas, as specified by the bill. Unless granted a waiver, a grantee shall provide matching funds equal to 10% of the grant amount. Each grant recipient shall conduct an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the program carried out under the grant.\n\nIn addition, the bill establishes the Full-Service Community Schools grant program. A \"full-service community school\" is a public elementary or secondary school that participates in a community-based effort to coordinate, integrate, and provide year-round access to educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services for students, families, and the community. Each grant recipient shall provide matching funds based on a sliding scale that accounts for the grantee's ability to obtain matching funds and the relative poverty of the grantee's targeted population. However, ED may not consider an applicant's ability to match funds when determining which applicants will be awarded grants under the program. ED must award a portion of grant funds to grantees in rural areas, as specified by the bill.\n\nWith respect to program guidance, the bill establishes principles of effectiveness as well as a Full-Service Community Schools Advisory Committee.\n\nThe bill also establishes a Promise Neighborhoods grant program, through which eligible entities shall provide pipeline services to address the needs of children in low-income and distressed neighborhoods. \"Pipeline services\" form a continuum of coordinated supports, services, and opportunities from a child's birth through postsecondary education and career attainment. The bill establishes certain limitations on the use of grant funds for early childhood education programs with respect to assessment activities. Unless granted a waiver, each grant recipient shall provide matching funds equal to at least 100% of the amount of the grant. ED must award a portion of grant funds to grantees in rural areas, as specified by the bill.\n\nED shall establish performance indicators for the program as well as provide technical assistance and program evaluation.\n\nThe bill establishes the Project School Emergency Response to Violence program (Project SERV), through which eligible entities may initiate or strengthen violence prevention activities designed to restore a learning environment that was disrupted by a violent or traumatic crisis. Grant funds shall be made at ED's discretion and shall not be used for facility construction or repair.\n\nED may use a portion of grant funds for national activities to carry out other efforts to improve students' safety and well-being, as specified by the bill.\n\nIn addition, ED shall annually award competitive grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to eligible entities for the purposes of enriching students' academic experience by promoting: (1) arts education for disadvantaged and disabled students, (2) school readiness through the development and dissemination of accessible instructional programing for preschool and elementary school children and their families, and (3) support for high-ability learners and high-ability learning through the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program.\n\nED must establish a National Research Center for the Education of Gifted and Talented Children and Youth for the purpose of carrying out activities under the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program.\n\nTITLE V--STATE INNOVATION AND LOCAL FLEXIBILITY\n\n(Sec. 5003) The bill increases the minimum and maximum grant award amounts under the Rural Education Assistance Programs.

Prohibits an abortion from being performed if the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child is 20 weeks or greater, except: (1) where necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman; (2) where the pregnancy is the result of rape against an adult woman and, at least 48 hours prior to the abortion, such woman has obtained counseling or medical treatment for the rape; or (3) where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest against a minor and the rape or incest has been reported prior to the abortion to a law enforcement agency or a government agency. Requires the physician, prior to performing such an abortion, to place appropriate supporting documentation in the patient's medical file.\n\nPermits a physician to terminate a pregnancy under such an exception only in the manner that provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive. Requires a physician performing an abortion under an exception provided by this Act, if the pain-capable unborn child has the potential to survive outside the womb, to ensure that a second physician trained in neonatal resuscitation is present and prepared to provide care to the child. Makes such requirements and the requirement to obtain an informed consent form inapplicable if compliance would pose a greater risk of the death or the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\n\nRequires, when a physician performs or attempts an abortion in accordance with this Act and the child is born alive, that:\n\n any health care practitioner present at the time humanely exercise the same professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as would be exercised for a child born alive at the same gestational age in the course of a natural birth; the child be immediately transported and admitted to a hospital; and a health care practitioner or any employee of a hospital, a physician's office, or an abortion clinic who has knowledge of a failure to comply with these requirements immediately report the failure to an appropriate state or federal law enforcement agency. Requires the physician who intends to perform an abortion under one of this Act's exceptions to first obtain a signed informed consent authorization form, which shall consist of:\n\n a statement by the physician indicating the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child; a statement that federal law allows an abortion after 20 weeks fetal age only if the mother's life is endangered when the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest against a minor; a statement that the abortion must be performed by the method most likely to allow the child to be born alive unless this would cause significant risk to the mother; a statement that in any case in which an abortion procedure results in a child born alive, federal law requires that child to be given every form of medical assistance that is provided to children spontaneously born prematurely; a statement that these requirements are binding upon the physician and all other medical personnel who are subject to criminal and civil penalties and that a woman on whom an abortion has been performed may take civil action if these requirements are not followed; and affirmation that each signer has filled out the informed consent form and understands the information contained in the form. Requires the form to be: (1) signed in person by the woman seeking the abortion, the physician performing the abortion, and a witness; and (2) retained in the patient's medical file for six years from the later of the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect.\n\nMakes this Act's requirements for the exception, where the pregnancy is the result of rape against an adult woman, that the woman has obtained counseling or medical treatment for the rape at least 48 hours prior to the abortion inapplicable if the rape has been reported prior to the abortion to a law enforcement agency or Department of Defense victim assistance personnel.\n\nRequires a physician who performs an abortion under an exception provided by this Act to comply with: (1) state laws regarding reporting requirements in cases of rape or incest as the state's Attorney General may designate, and (2) any applicable state laws requiring parental involvement in a minor's decision to have an abortion.\n\nBars prosecution of a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of this Act for violating or conspiring to violate this Act.\n\nAuthorizes: (1) a woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in violation of this Act to obtain specified appropriate relief in a civil action, and (2) a parent of a minor upon whom an abortion has been performed under an exception and that was performed in violation of this Act to obtain such relief unless the pregnancy resulted from the plaintiff's criminal conduct.\n\nRequires any physician who performs an abortion under this Act's exceptions to annually submit a summary of all such abortions to the National Center for Health Statistics, which shall issue a public report annually providing statistics by state for the previous year.\n\nDefines \"abortion\" to mean the use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other substance or device: (1) to intentionally kill an unborn child of a woman known to be pregnant;

Requires the President, after such designation, to identify, and provide public notice of, additional renewable energy trunkline facilities and network upgrades required to increase substantially the generation of electricity from renewable energy within each Zone. Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to promulgate regulations to ensure that a public utility that finances transmission capacity to transmit electricity from renewable energy from a Zone to an electricity consuming area recovers through transmission service rates all prudently incurred costs and a reasonable return on equity associated with construction and operation of the new transmission capacity. Directs FERC, in specified circumstances, to permit a renewable energy trunkline built by a public utility located in a Zone to be initially funded through transmission charges imposed upon: (1) all the utility's transmission customers in advance of significant generation interconnection requests; or (2) all the transmission customers of a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) or independent system operator, if the trunkline is built in an area served by one or the other. Prescribes cost allocation procedures for new projects and network upgrades. Requires a Federal Transmitting Utility (a Federal Power Marketing Administration, including the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), that owns or operates electric transmission facilities) to finance a network upgrade or a renewable energy trunkline facility, if within a certain time frame no privately or publicly funded entity commits to do so. Authorizes the deposit of specified funds in a Transmission Fund in the Treasury for expenditure by the Secretary of Energy in financing network upgrades or trunkline facilities. Requires the Federal Power Marketing Administrations and TVA to: (1) promote energy conservation and renewable energy electric resource development; and (2) identify opportunities for promoting development of facilities generating electricity from renewable energy on Indian lands.

Extends until January 1, 2020: (1) the prohibition on exclusive retransmission consent contracts, and (2) the requirement that television broadcast stations and MVPDs negotiate in good faith.\n\n(Sec. 102) Limits the definition of \"local market,\" in the case of both commercial and noncommercial television broadcast stations, to the designated market area in which a television broadcast station is located, including with respect to a commercial television broadcast station any modifications made by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under procedures set forth in this Act to add communities to or exclude communities from a station's local market following a written request. (Currently, the definition incorporates federal copyright laws that expand the definition of a local market to include all commercial television broadcast stations licensed to a community within the same designated market area, stations licensed to a community within the same designated market area as a noncommercial educational television broadcast station, and the county in which the station's community of license is located.)\n\nRequires designated market areas, for purposes of determining a satellite carrier's obligations to carry local television signals, to be determined by Nielsen Media Research.\n\nAllows the FCC, following a written request with respect to a particular commercial television broadcast station, to add communities to or exclude communities from a station's local market. Directs the FCC, in considering such requests, to afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account factors including: (1) whether the station has been carried historically within such community; (2) whether the station provides coverage or other local service to such community; (3) whether modifying the local market of the television station would promote consumers' access to television broadcast station signals that originate in their state of residence; (4) whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a satellite carrier in such community covers news, sporting, and other events of interest to the community; and (5) viewing patterns in households that subscribe and do not subscribe to MVPD services.\n\nPermits the FCC to determine that communities are part of more than one local market.\n\nProhibits the FCC's market determinations from creating additional carriage obligations that are not technically and economically feasible for a satellite carrier by means of its satellites in operation at the time of the determination.\n\nProhibits a satellite carrier from deleting from carriage the signal of a commercial television broadcast station during the pendency of any such proceeding.\n\nRequires the FCC's website to explain the market modification process, including information regarding: (1) who may petition to include communities within, or exclude communities from, a local market or television market; and (2) the factors the FCC takes into account.\n\nTitle II: Video Policy Reforms - (Sec. 201) Directs the FCC to commence a rulemaking proceeding to revise regulations governing the exercise by television broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent. Requires such revised regulations to prohibit television broadcast stations, unless such stations are under common de jure control permitted by the FCC, from: (1) coordinating negotiations or negotiating on a joint basis with another television broadcast station in the same local market to grant retransmission consent to an MVPD, and (2) limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry a television signal that has been deemed significantly viewed (or any other television broadcast signal such distributor is authorized to carry under current laws governing the carriage of local, distant, or significantly viewed television signals by satellite carriers or the carriage of local commercial television signals by cable operators) into the local market of such station.\n\nDirects the FCC to review and update its totality of the circumstances test for good faith negotiations to ensure that the test encourages parties to a retransmission consent negotiation to present bona fide proposals and engage in timely negotiations.\n\n(Sec. 202) Requires the FCC's annual report on cable rates to include the aggregate average total amount that cable systems pay for retransmission consent.\n\n(Sec. 203) Terminates on the date that is two years after this Act's enactment the FCC's set-top box integration ban that prohibits MVPDs from placing in service new navigation devices that perform both conditional access and other functions in a single integrated device. Directs the FCC to convene a working group to identify and recommend standards for a not unduly burdensome, uniform, technology-neutral, software-based, downloadable security system that promotes the competitive availability of such devices.\n\n(Sec. 204) Requires the FCC to establish a streamlined process for the filing of effective competition petitions (if the FCC finds that a cable system is subject to effective competition, the rates for the provision of cable service by such system are not subject to regulation by the FCC, states, or franchising authorities) by small cable operators, particularly those that serve primarily rural areas. Prohibits this Act from being construed to have any effect on the duty of a small cable operator to prove the existence of effective competition.\n\n(Sec. 205) Requires the FCC to submit to Congress: (1) an analysis of consumers' access to broadcast programming from television broadcast stations located outside their local market, (2) alternatives to designated market areas to provide consumers with more local programming options, and (3) recommendations to increase localism in counties served by out-of-state designated market areas.\n\nTitle III: Miscellaneous - Directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to implement this Act.

Revises Medicare requirements for group health plans to extend from 12 to 42 months after an individual becomes eligible for Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled) benefits the period during which a group health plan is a primary payer (and Medicare the secondary payer) for ESRD patients. Requires such a plan to: (1) provide adequate, advanced, written notice to patients regarding changes to dialysis service benefits, new restrictions on out-of-network access, or reductions in rates paid for out-of-network benefits; (2) allow patients to continue using their existing provider or facility for dialysis services for at least 24 months after a plan or issuer notice of any change; (3) hold patients harmless from a provider network change if the change requires unreasonable drive time or disrupts the physician-patient relationship; (4) ensure that out-of-pocket payments for such services apply to the Medicare part C (Medicare+Choice Program) out-of-pocket maximums and are treated as non-routine for copayment purposes; and (5) meet minimum network adequacy standards. Prohibits such a plan from: (1) restricting the duration or number of dialysis sessions for patients to less than the number for which payment may be made; (2) requiring assignment of benefits for such services; or (3) denying or limiting coverage for patients for such services if premiums, copayments, or other payments are made by third parties on their behalf. Directs the Secretary to study: (1) the social, behavioral, and biological factors leading to kidney disease; and (2) efforts to slow the progression of kidney disease in minority populations that are disproportionately affected by it. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the research gaps with respect to the development of quality metrics and care management metrics for ESRD patients. Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate the transportation barriers facing dialysis patients that result in less than 100% compliance with their plan of care under the Medicare program. Includes as a person qualified to furnish kidney disease education services an RDF with a physician or a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist. Declares that the mandatory single payment to an RDF or other provider of renal dialysis services shall not take into account the amount of payment for kidney disease education services.

Requires the Director of National Intelligence to: (1) establish procedures to allow intelligence community elements to share cyber threat intelligence with private-sector entities and utilities, and (2) encourage the sharing of such intelligence. Requires the procedures established to ensure that such intelligence is only: (1) shared with certified entities or a person with an appropriate security clearance, (2) shared consistent with the need to protect U.S. national security, and (3) used in a manner that protects such intelligence from unauthorized disclosure. Provides for guidelines for the granting of security clearance approvals to certified entities or officers or employees of such entities. Prohibits a certified entity receiving such intelligence from further disclosing the information to any entity other than another certified entity or a federal department or agency authorized to receive such intelligence. Authorizes a cybersecurity provider (a non-governmental entity that provides goods or services intended to be used for cybersecurity purposes), with the express consent of a protected entity (an entity that contracts with a cybersecurity provider) to: (1) use cybersecurity systems to identify and obtain cyber threat information in order to protect the rights and property of the protected entity; and (2) share cyber threat information with any other entity designated by the protected entity, including the federal government.

Denies the District any authority to enact laws or regulations that discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms. Declares that nothing in such prohibitions shall be construed to prohibit the District from regulating or prohibiting the carrying of firearms by a person, either concealed or openly, other than at the person's dwelling place, place of business, or on other land possessed by the person.

Requires such systems to be enhanced physically, electronically, or redundantly to improve their survivability in the event of a mine disaster.Prohibits miners from being disciplined based on information obtained from an electronic communications and tracking system.Provides that the requirement that a plan provide for supplies of breathable air for individuals trapped underground may not be satisfied by the placement of an order within a company for future delivery of a portable refuge chamber or other means of providing such emergency supplies of breathable air. Requires the Secretary of Labor to issue interim final regulations, consistent with the design criteria recommended by NIOSH, requiring each emergency response plan to provide for the installation of portable rescue chambers or refuge shelters carved out of the mine working and sealed with bulkheads. Requires a portable refuge chamber to be installed and maintained within 500 feet of the nearest working face in each working section of an underground coal mine.Amends the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 to repeal provisions concerning standards relating to the sealing of abandoned areas in mines. Requires the Secretary to: (1) inspect seals during construction to ensure the mine operator is complying with the seal plan; and (2) issue rules regarding approval, design, construction, inspection, maintenance and monitoring of underground coal mine seals. Requires such regulations to provide that: (1) seal sampling pipes shall be composed of materials that minimize the risk of transmitting any electrical charge and no conductive materials may be used to line boreholes within three feet of the surface; and (2) an action plan for sealing and repair be established that will include specific actions the mine operator will take to protect miners immediately after sealing or repair takes place, which shall be reviewed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA); and (3) methane pressures behind seals required to be monitored shall be maintained in such a manner as to ensure that normal pressure variations that can be reasonable anticipated in the area of the seal do not bring the methane-air mixture into an appropriate safety range surrounding the known explosive range of such mixtures.Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish interim final regulations to enhance the survivability of underground mine ventilation controls; (2) require that stoppings be constructed in a specified manner.Requires: (1) NIOSH to issue recommendations as to whether changes to rock dusting requirements are necessary to ensure an equivalent level of protection in light of any changes to the size and composition of coal dust since these requirements were established; and (2) the Secretary to take appropriate action, including the issuance of an emergency temporary standard if warranted, to respond to such recommendations.Requires the Secretary to publish, within 90 days, interim final rules to revise the requirements for flame resistant conveyor belts to ensure that they meet NIOSH's most recent recommendations and are designed to limit smoke and toxic emissions. Exempts conveyor belts that: (1) were ordered, in a mine's inventory, or installed prior to enactment of this Act or that were ordered after enactment if the Secretary certifies that the mine operator was unable to obtain a belt meeting such requirements; or (2) have been in use for more than five years and have been inspected annually by a certified professional to ensure they are free from visible defects that could cause failure or possible ignition.Requires the Secretary, no later than June 20, 2008, to revise belt air regulations to require that belt haulage entries not be used to ventilate active working places in coal mines, regardless of the date opened. Authorizes the Secretary to agree to a modification of such requirement if the mine operator: (1) establishes that significant safety constraints require such usage; and (2) agrees to comply with criteria established by the Secretary that includes the conditions recommended by the Technical Study Panel.Requires: (1) mine operators to be required to implement a communication program at each of their facilities to ensure that each person entering the operation is made aware at the start of that person's shift of the current conditions of the mine and of that person's specific worksite; (2) operators' agents who are responsible for ensuring safe and healthful working conditions to communicate with those replacing them on the conditions they observed during their shift, including conditions that are abnormal or hazardous; (3) oncoming agents, prior to entering the mine or other workplace, to meet with all members of their crew and inform them of the general conditions at the operation and in their work area; and (4) such agents, in the event an operation is idle prior to the start of a shift, to meet with the individuals who were responsible for examining the mine to obtain the necessary information.Requires an operator of an underground mine to install atmospheric monitoring systems in underground areas where miners normally work and travel that provide real-time information regarding carbon monoxide levels, and that can withstand explosions and fires.Requires each miner who is working alone for part of a shift to be equipped with a multi-gas detector that measures current levels of methane, oxygen, and carbon monoxide.Requires the National Academy of Sciences to submit to the Secretary and to Congress recommendations on: (1) actions that need to be taken to strengthen existing law to ensure that miners are protected from the risks of lightning strikes near a mine; (2) adopting existing technology to the mining environment to minimize such risks; and (3) research needed for improved technology.Requires the Secretary to ensure the appropriate use of roof screen in belt entries, travel roads, and designated intake and return escapeways. Sets forth regulations concerning roof screening requirements and barrier reduction or pillar extraction plans. Requires an operator to have a current and approved reduction or extraction plan, or both, before performing reduction or extraction activities. Directs the Secretary to approve such plans only if they: (1) provide adequate protection and minimize the risks for miners engaged in such activity, reflecting engineering analysis, computer simulations, and consultations with technical experts; and (2) comply with requirements that may be adopted by the Secretary for such activities, including requirements related to the depth of the mine, geology of the mine, mine height and methods, and emergency response capabilities. Requires a copy of such plan to be provided to representatives of miners and authorizes such representatives to provide comments to the Secretary, who is required to respond. Requires the Secretary, before approving reduction or extraction plans for depths below 1,500 feet and in mines with a history of mountain bumps, to establish a special internal review process that requires: (1) operators to notify MSHA before commencement of operations to ensure miners are trained; and (2) the Secretary to observe such operations for a sufficient period of time to ensure that the mine operator is complying with the plan. Authorizes the Secretary to preclude or halt the commencement of such operations when the safety of the miners comes into question.Requires NIOSH to submit to the Secretary and Congress recommendations for: (1) actions to strengthen existing requirements to ensure that miners are protected from ground control hazards, including the special hazards associated with barrier reduction and pillar extraction; (2) adopting existing technology to the mining environment to improve miner protections during barrier reduction and pillar extraction, during mining at depths below 1,000 feet, and during secondary mining of coal resources; and (3) research needed for improved technology to improve miner protections during such operations.Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a self-contained self-rescuers inspection program to randomly remove and test samples of each model of self-rescue device used in an underground coal mine in order to ensure that such devices are working in accordance with approved criteria; (2) require a manufacturer of a self-rescue device and the mine operator who owns a device to contact the Secretary immediately upon notification of any potential problem with such devices and to provide notice to the representative of miners at the affected operation; and (3) notify immediately operators of underground coal mines if the Secretary detects or is advised of problems with such devices.Applies the regulations concerning conveyor belts in underground coal mines to conveyor belts and seals of abandoned areas in underground metal and nonmetal mines.Applies the regulations concerning the approval, design, construction, inspection, maintenance, and monitoring of underground coal mine seals to seals in underground metal and nonmetal mines which have been classified by the Secretary as a category I, III, or V mine because they naturally emit defined quantities of methane.Requires the Secretary to establish an advisory committee on regulations applicable to underground metal and nonmetal mines.Sets forth priorities for MSHA's approval center.Requires NIOSH to give priority in its research to specified technologies that could help miners in an emergency.(Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to establish a Master Inspector program to provide incentives for employees to serve as inspectors.Establishes, within the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Labor, the position of Miner Ombudsman, whose duties shall include ensuring that the rights of miners are upheld and that miners' complaints are kept confidential.

Provides for a civil penalty for operators who retaliate against miners who report safety and health violations.Requires the Secretary to establish: (1) an advisory committee to make recommendations on whether the Mine Act should provide for federal licensing of mines and mine personnel to ensure that those engaged in mining activities are not frequent violators of safety and health requirements; and (2) a national registry of violators.(Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to establish: (1) a central communications emergency call center within the Mine Safety and Health Administration; (2) maps on the Department of Labor's website showing the locations of operating and abandoned mines; and (3) a repository for preserving a digital archive of mining maps to be accessible on such website.Requires a mine operator to notify the Secretary of reportable events that include: (1) a fire not required to be reported more promptly; (2) a sudden change in mine atmospheric conditions in a sealed area; (3) a coal or rock outburst that causes the withdrawal of miners; or (4) other events that need to be reported within one hour in order for the Secretary to determine if the working conditions in the mine are safe. Requires regulations concerning mine rescue teams to provide for uniform credentials and coordination with local emergency response personnel. Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to require NIOSH to research advanced drilling and special technologies required for safety or rescue in mining more than 1,500 in depth.Requires the Secretary to establish guidelines for rescue operations that will: (1) establish clear lines of authority within MSHA for such operations; (2) establish clear lines of demarcation so private sector and state responders can properly implement their responsibilities; and (3) be appropriate for rescue in various types of conditions reasonably likely to be encountered, addressing such factors as the depth of the mining, ground stability, ground slope, remoteness from major roads, surface ownership and access problems, and the availability of necessary communications linkages. Requires an operator, if the Secretary supervises and directs rescue and recovery activities in the operator's mine, to comply with the Secretary's requests to facilitate such activities, including the provision of equipment and personnel. Considers failure of the operator to comply with such requests as an egregious violation of such Act.Requires the Secretary to: (1) designate a full-time permanent MSHA employee to serve as a Family Liaison to act as the primary communicator with the families of trapped miners throughout the rescue operation; (2) direct MSHA to be responsive to request from families of miners for information relating to the accident and to waive document production fees; and (3) designate a representative of the Secretary with specified qualifications to serve as the primary communicator with the press and the public.Requires rescue efforts for trapped miners to continue as long as there is any possibility that miners are alive, unless such efforts pose a serious danger to rescue or other workers. Requires the decision to cease a rescue to be made by the Secretary's representative.Requires the Secretary, for accident and incident investigations under the Mine Act, to determine: (1) why the accident or incident occurred; (2) whether civil or criminal requirements were violated and, if so, to issue citations and penalties and make recommendations to avoid recurrence; and (3) whether the conduct or lack thereof of MSHA personnel contributed to the accident or incident. Requires an independent investigation for accidents or incidents involving multiple serious injuries or deaths or multiple entrapments.

The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nDrinking Water Protection Act \n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and submit to Congress a strategic plan for assessing and managing risks associated with algal toxins in drinking water provided by public water systems. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, have the ability to produce cyanotoxins, or algal toxins. When certain conditions are favorable, algae can rapidly multiply causing blooms, or dense surface scums, that may be toxic.\n\nThe plan must include steps and time lines to:\n\n evaluate the risk to human health from drinking water contaminated with algal toxins; establish, publish, and update a comprehensive list of algal toxins that may have an adverse effect on human health, taking into account likely exposure levels; summarize the known adverse human health effects of algal toxins and the factors that cause toxin-producing cyanobacteria and algae to grow rapidly and make toxins; determine whether to publish health advisories for algal toxins and establish guidance regarding feasible analytical methods to quantify the presence of algal toxins and guidance regarding the frequency of monitoring necessary to determine if the algal toxins are present; recommend feasible treatment options, including procedures, equipment, and source water protection practices; and enter into cooperative agreements with, and provide technical assistance to, affected states and public water systems to manage risks associated with algal toxins. The EPA must update and resubmit the plan as appropriate.\n\nThe EPA must identify gaps in its understanding of algal toxins. It must also assemble and publish information from each agency that has examined or analyzed cyanobacteria or algal toxins or addressed public health concerns related to harmful algal blooms. The Government Accountability Office must submit to Congress an inventory of funds expended by the United States for each of FY2010 through 2014 to examine or analyze toxin-producing cyanobacteria and algae or address public health concerns related to harmful algal blooms. The inventory must include the specific purpose for which the funds were made available, the law under which the funds were authorized, and the agency that received or spent the funds.","topic":"Environment","subtopic":"Drinking Water","subjects_top_term":"Environmental protection","date":1420675200000,"tokenized_text":"measure amended passed house february summary version repeated drinking water protection act sec bill amends safe_drinking_water_act direct environmental_protection_agency epa develop submit congress strategic plan assessing managing risks associated algal toxins drinking water provided public water systems cyanobacteria known blue green algae ability produce algal toxins certain conditions favorable algae rapidly causing blooms dense surface toxic plan include steps time lines evaluate risk human health drinking water contaminated algal toxins establish publish update comprehensive list algal toxins adverse effect human health taking account likely exposure levels summarize known adverse human health effects algal toxins factors cause toxin producing cyanobacteria algae grow rapidly toxins determine publish health advisories algal toxins establish guidance feasible analytical methods quantify presence algal toxins guidance frequency monitoring necessary determine algal toxins present recommend feasible treatment options including procedures equipment source water protection practices enter cooperative agreements provide technical assistance affected states public water systems manage risks associated algal toxins epa update resubmit plan appropriate epa identify gaps understanding algal toxins assemble publish information agency examined analyzed cyanobacteria algal toxins addressed public health concerns related harmful algal blooms government_accountability_office submit congress inventory funds expended united_states fy2010 examine analyze toxin producing cyanobacteria algae address public health concerns related harmful algal blooms inventory include specific purpose funds available law funds authorized agency received spent funds"}

Eliminates requirements that Medicaid benchmark benefits: (1) provide minimum essential coverage, and (2) ensure parity in the financial requirements and treatment limitations in medical and surgical benefits, on the one hand, and mental health or substance use disorder benefits, on the other.
